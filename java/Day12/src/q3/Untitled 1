answer 3: Abstrat methods are thos that must be implemented by a subclass, while concrete methods are thos that can bve impletmented as is. An interface is a type 
of abstract

Abstrarct class cannot be instantiated , cannot be implemented by a class, abstract class are typically used to define the interface 
it can obtain from the abstract and concrete
by abstract we got partially unimplemented structure
and bys interface we get 100 % unimplemented structure.
