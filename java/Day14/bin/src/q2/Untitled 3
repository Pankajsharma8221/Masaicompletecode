arrays are linear data structures providing functionality to add elements in a continuous manner in memory address space whereas ArrayList is a class belonging to the Collection framework. Being a good programmer one is already aware of using ArrayList over arrays despite knowing the differences between these two. Now moving ahead even with ArrayList there comes a functionality to pass the type of datatype of elements that are supposed to be stored in the ArrayList be it an object, string, integer, double, float, etc. 
In Java, the following are two different ways to create an array. 

Simple fixed-sized arrays
Dynamically sized arrays
int arr[] = new int[10]   




Arraylist<Type> al = new ArrayList<Type> ;
// Here Type is the type of elements in ArrayList to be created


  ArrayList<Integer> arrL = new ArrayList<Integer>(2);
 
        // Adding elements to ArrayList
        // using add() method
        arrL.add(1);
        arrL.add(2);
 
        // Printing alongside accessing
        // elements of ArrayList
        System.out.println(arrL.get(0));
