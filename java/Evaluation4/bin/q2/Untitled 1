hashcode method return the same hash value when called on two objects, which are equals() methods. And if the objects are unequal, it usually return difference hash value.

equal is the method of jav.lang it is used to compare two objects.
it compare two projects that whether they are same, it compares the values of both the objects's attributes.
Two objects are same when they stored in same memory location.

if two objects are the same as per the equals methodm then if we call the hashcode methos on each of the two , must provide same integer result.

if for 2 oobjects equal will returns true then their hashcode value should the sma value for both of the objects.
there aree three cases for override equals and hashcode method inside our classes are

1. whenver we try to make our objects logically equal.
2. whenver we try to add our objects inside the hashset or linkedHashset class.
3. whenever we try to add our object as a key inside the hashmap class.
