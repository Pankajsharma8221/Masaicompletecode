A static method is a method that belongs to a class, but it does not belong to an instance of that class and this method can be called without the instance or object of that class.
 Every method in java defaults to a non-static method without static keyword preceding it.
  Non-static methods can access any static method and static variable, without creating an instance of the object. 
A static method can only access static data members and static methods of another class or same class but cannot access non-static methods and variables.
Also, a static method can rewrite the values of any static data member.
A non-static method can access static data members and static methods as well as non-static members and methods of another class or same class, also can change the values of any static data member
