Ans1: The java platform is independent the java-compiled code can run all over the operating systems. because it contains its own Java
development kit's virtual machine which will easily run all operating systems like mac/Linux/window.Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine.
 The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent.
 The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different platforms.
 and there are various reasons for the independency of java when we execute that code the java file converts into the
 classes after converting into class it will execute in any operating systm
 
 Ans3:  package com.month;

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
int a =64;
int b=70;
byte c=(byte)(a+b);
System.out.println(c);  
	}

}
here  it is because its range is between -128 to -127 firt we add the both of value after that we subtract that from the 128 after that we got 6 after getting 6 we add that value in -127 it becomes -122
