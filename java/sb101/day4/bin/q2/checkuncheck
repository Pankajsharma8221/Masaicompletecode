checked exception is like that those exception checked at compile time
is checked exception like classnotfound and filenotfound
unchecked exception are thos which telll us while runtime that type of exception is
happend when we need logic to pu that ogive unchecked exception
the excption are found only runtime but compiler check that exception that time.

package com.masai;

public class Demo{
	
	
	
	public int getPension(int age, int salary) {
		
		int pension = 0;
		
		if(age > 40 && age < 100)
			pension = (age * salary)/100;
		else {
			
			
			
			ArithmeticException ae = new ArithmeticException("Invalid Age :" + age);
			throw ae;
			
		//this exception is generated based on logical error occurs due to the business logic violation	
			
		}
		
		
		
		
		
		
		return pension;
		
	}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("inside main of Demo");
		
		
		Demo d1= new Demo();
		
		try {
		int result= d1.getPension(60, 50000);
		
		
		System.out.println(result);
		}catch (ArithmeticException ae) {
			System.out.println(ae.getMessage());
		}
			
			
			
		
		System.out.println("end of main...");
		
	}
	
}

that is the example of unchecked exception


classNotFound is the example of checked exception
