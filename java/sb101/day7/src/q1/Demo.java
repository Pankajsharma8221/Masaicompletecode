//Q1/- Create a Product bean class with the following properties:
//productId
//productName
//price
//quantity
//‚óè From the main method of the Demo class performs the following operations:
//1. Create a List of 5 product objects.
//2. From the product list filter the products whose quantity is more than 10 in a
//separate List of Products.
//3. Sort the Filtered List of Products by the price in ascending order.
//4. Print all the products one by one from both Lists (original list and Filtered list)
//Note: for filtering and printing and sorting make use of Stream or Lambda
//expressions.
