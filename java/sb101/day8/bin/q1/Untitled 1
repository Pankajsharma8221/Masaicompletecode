Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?


Multithreading is a programmingn concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel.
if you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A 
simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. This is a single-threaded application.
But, if the programming langauage supports creating multple threads and passes them to the operating system to run
in paraller, it is called multithreading.

multithreading in java is executing multiple threads simultaneaously.



importance
1.it doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.

2. You can perfrom may operation together, so it savce time.
3 thread are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads it an exception occurs in single thread.
