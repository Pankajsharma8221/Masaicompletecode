Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?

The benefit of multthreading is

1 Improved throughput. Many concurrent compute operations and I/O requests within a single process.

2. Simultaneouus and fully symmetric use of mutiple processors for computation and I/O

3. Superior application respnsiveness. If a request can be lauched on its own thread, application do ot freeze or show the "hourglass". An 
Entire application wil not bloc, or otherwise wait , pending the completion of another request.

4. Minimized system resource usage. Thread impose minimal impact on system rerources. Threads requrire less overhead to create, maintain, and mangage than a tradictional process.
