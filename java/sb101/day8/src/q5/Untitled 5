Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
Thread?

Thread class and runnable interface are the two structures using whicvh we implements thread based mutititasking in java.
The signature of function using which we implemtn a thread is defined in an interface by the name Runnable this runnable interface belong to java.lang package.
 public void run();
 inside this run() method we need to define the functionalit, that we want to execute as a thread along with the main thread. After providing the body we need to execfute this functionalit as a threacd ( i.e. simultaneously with the other part of the program).
 
 there uis a class by the name Thread present in java.lang package, which has a method called start(), this start() metyhod is used to execute a gi en functionality defined inside the run() method of Runnable interface as a separate thread.
 
 This start() method of the Thread class recognise the run() method of the Runnable interface and then ahe run() method is executed as a saparate indiviudals thread.
 class A implements Runnable{
@Override
public void run(){
//define the taks which we want to execute as a thread
}
}
//or
class A extends Thread
{
@Override
public void run(){
//define the taks which we want to execute as a thread
}
}

internally the thread calss implements the runnable interface and override run() with empty implementation
