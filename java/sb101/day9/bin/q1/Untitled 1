Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?


class SynchronizationExample implements Runnable{
@Override
public void run() {
incrementMe();
unSynchronizedShowMe();
}
synchronized void incrementMe() {
for (int i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {
System. out .println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is printing : " +
i);
}
}
void unSynchronizedShowMe()
{
System. out .println("unSynchronized : "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
synchronized (this)
{
try {
Thread.sleep(4000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
for(int i = 0; i<5;i++)
System. out .println("printing from synchronized block :
"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
}
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
SynchronizationExample obj = new SynchronizationExample();
Thread threadOne = new Thread(obj,"Child One");
Thread threadtwo = new Thread(obj,"Child two");
threadOne.start();
threadtwo.start();
}
}

A synchronized method providea a lock corresponding tyo object-level or class level ( i.e. class level means static method), whereas,m synchronized clock provides a lock on any object depending on the parameter.


A synchronized method imposes lock on entire functionality of the respective method, while the synchronized block is used to lock a lesser number of consecutive statements (Critical section area).


Since, the synchronized method provides a lock on current instance otherwise class level, therefore, nullPointerException can't be expected. On the other hand, if the parameter evaluated as null, then there would be likely a nullPointerException occured.

Synchronized block boosts the performance of a respective program as it is intended to use on an only certain part of the program, rather than the entire method. Whereas the synchronized methgod lock entire functionality even though, some part of code has nothing to do with write or update.

Since, performance has an indirect relation with waiting time. In other words , the synchronized method increase the waiting time, whereas synchronized block has an advantage ove the method as tis scope is limited and smaller than the method.
