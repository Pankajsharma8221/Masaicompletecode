Q5/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method?


sleep() method 
this method causes the currently executing  thread to sleep fo the specified number of miliseconds, subject to the precision and accuracy of system timer and schedulers.

Syntax
import java.lang.*;
  
public class SleepD implements Runnable {
    Thread t;
    public void run()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            System.out.println(
                Thread.currentThread().getName() + "  "
                + i);
            try {
                // thread to sleep for 1000 milliseconds
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
  
            catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
  
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
    {
        Thread t = new Thread(new SleepDemo());
  
        // call run() function
        t.start();
  
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new SleepDemo());
  
        // call run() function
        t2.start();
    }
}

based on the rquriement we can make a th4read to be in  a sleepingt styate for a specified period of time.
Sleep() causes the thread to defineitly stop executing for a given amount of time; if no other thread or process needs to be run , the CPU 
will be idle ( and probbably enter a power-saving mode).


join() method 
the join method of a thread instance is used to join the start of thread's execution to the end of another thread's execution such that a thread does not start running until another thread ends.
if join() is called on a thread instance, the currently runing thread will block until the thread isntance has finished executing. The join () method wait at most this many miliseconds fo this thread to die. A timout of 0 means to wait forever.
import java.lang.*;
  
public class JoinD implements Runnable {
    public void run()
    {
        Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
        System.out.println("Current thread: "
                           + t.getName());
  
        // checks if current thread is alive
        System.out.println("Is Alive? " + t.isAlive());
    }
  
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception
    {
        Thread t = new Thread(new JoinDemo());
        t.start();
  
        // Waits for 1000ms this thread to die.
        t.join(1000);
  
        System.out.println("\nJoining after 1000"
                           + " milliseconds: \n");
        System.out.println("Current thread: "
                           + t.getName());
  
        // Checks if this thread is alive
        System.out.println("Is alive? " + t.isAlive());
    }
}
