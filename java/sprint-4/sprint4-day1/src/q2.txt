Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?

The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity. Consider a case where class B extends
class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display().
Now java compiler cannot decide, which display method it should inherit.
To prevent such situation, multiple inheritances is not allowed in java.
