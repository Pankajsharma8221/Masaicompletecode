Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList

1. ArrayList
. This class uses a dynamic array to store the elements in it. With the introduction of
 generics, this class supports the storage of all types of objects.
. Manipulating ArrayList takes more time due to the internal implementation. Whenever we
 remove an element, internally, the array is traversed and the memory bits are shifted
. This class implements a List interface. Therefore, this acts as a list.
. This class works better when the application demands storing the data and accessing it.

2. LinkedList
. This class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements in it. Similar to the ArrayList,
 this class also supports the storage of all types of objects.
. Manipulating LinkedList takes less time compared to ArrayList because, in a doubly-linked list,
 there is no concept of shifting the memory bits. The list is traversed and the reference link is changed.
. This class implements both the List interface and the Deque interface. Therefore, it can act as a
 list and a deque.
. This class works better when the application demands manipulation of the stored data.
