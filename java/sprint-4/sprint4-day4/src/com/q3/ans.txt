Explain the difference between comparable and comparator.

1. Comparable 
A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object.
The class itself must implements the java.lang.Comparable interface to
compare its instances. Consider a Movie class that has members like,
rating, name, year. Suppose we wish to sort a list of Movies based
on year of release. We can implement the Comparable interface with
the Movie class, and we override the method compareTo() of Comparable interface. 

2. Comparator

Unlike Comparable, Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing.
Itâ€™s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator)
to compare by different members.Collections class has a second sort() method and
it takes Comparator. The sort() method invokes the compare() to sort objects.
To compare movies by Rating, we need to do 3 things :
